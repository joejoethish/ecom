# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The review API implementation has type inconsistencies where some methods return data directly while others return ApiResponse<T> format. The useReviews hook expects all API methods to follow the ApiResponse<T> pattern, causing TypeScript errors. This feature will standardize all review API methods to return consistent ApiResponse<T> format and update the useReviews hook accordingly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all review API methods to return consistent ApiResponse<T> format, so that the useReviews hook can handle responses uniformly without type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any review API method is called THEN it SHALL return an ApiResponse<T> format with success, data, and error properties
2. WHEN getReviews is called THEN it SHALL return ApiResponse<PaginatedResponse<Review>> instead of PaginatedResponse<Review>
3. WHEN getProductReviews is called THEN it SHALL return ApiResponse<PaginatedResponse<Review>> instead of PaginatedResponse<Review>
4. WHEN createReview is called THEN it SHALL return ApiResponse<Review> instead of Review
5. WHEN updateReview is called THEN it SHALL return ApiResponse<Review> instead of Review
6. WHEN getReview is called THEN it SHALL return ApiResponse<Review> instead of Review

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the useReviews hook to properly handle the standardized API responses, so that there are no TypeScript compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useReviews hook calls any API method THEN it SHALL properly access response.data for the actual data
2. WHEN API calls succeed THEN the hook SHALL check response.success before accessing response.data
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the hook SHALL handle response.error appropriately
4. WHEN fetchReviews processes the response THEN it SHALL access response.data.results for the reviews array
5. WHEN fetchReviews processes the response THEN it SHALL access response.data.pagination.count for the total count

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for all review API operations, so that users receive meaningful error messages when operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API method fails THEN it SHALL throw an error with a meaningful message
2. WHEN response.success is false THEN the error message SHALL come from response.error.message if available
3. WHEN response.data is null or undefined THEN appropriate fallback error messages SHALL be used
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and re-thrown with appropriate error messages
