# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Forgot Password System provides users with a secure way to reset their passwords when they cannot access their accounts. This system includes email-based verification, secure token generation, and a complete password reset flow that integrates with the existing authentication system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has forgotten my password, I want to request a password reset via email, so that I can regain access to my account securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters their email address on the forgot password form THEN the system SHALL validate the email format
2. WHEN a user submits a valid email address THEN the system SHALL check if the email exists in the database
3. IF the email exists THEN the system SHALL generate a secure reset token and send a password reset email
4. IF the email does not exist THEN the system SHALL display a generic success message to prevent email enumeration attacks
5. WHEN the reset email is sent THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with the submitted email address
6. WHEN a user clicks "Try Different Email" THEN the system SHALL return to the email input form

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a password reset email with a secure link, so that I can safely reset my password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL generate a cryptographically secure token with 32+ characters
2. WHEN generating a reset token THEN the system SHALL set an expiration time of 1 hour from creation
3. WHEN sending the reset email THEN the system SHALL include a link with the reset token as a URL parameter
4. WHEN sending the reset email THEN the system SHALL include clear instructions and branding consistent with the application
5. WHEN a reset token is generated THEN the system SHALL store it in the database with the user ID and expiration timestamp
6. WHEN a new reset token is generated for a user THEN the system SHALL invalidate any existing reset tokens for that user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the reset link and set a new password, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a password reset link THEN the system SHALL validate the token exists and is not expired
2. IF the token is valid THEN the system SHALL display a password reset form
3. IF the token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL display an error message and option to request a new reset
4. WHEN a user enters a new password THEN the system SHALL validate password strength requirements
5. WHEN a user confirms their new password THEN the system SHALL verify both passwords match
6. WHEN a valid new password is submitted THEN the system SHALL update the user's password hash in the database
7. WHEN the password is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate the reset token and redirect to login

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want password reset attempts to be logged and rate-limited, so that the system is protected from abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with timestamp, IP address, and email
2. WHEN multiple reset requests are made from the same IP THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting of 5 requests per hour
3. WHEN rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return an error message and temporarily block further requests
4. WHEN a password reset is completed THEN the system SHALL log the successful reset with timestamp and user ID
5. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators via configured notification channels

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the password reset process to be secure and protect against common attacks, so that my account remains safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reset tokens THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random number generation
2. WHEN storing reset tokens THEN the system SHALL hash the tokens before database storage
3. WHEN validating reset tokens THEN the system SHALL use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
4. WHEN a reset token is used THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate it to prevent reuse
5. WHEN displaying success messages THEN the system SHALL not reveal whether an email address exists in the system
6. WHEN handling reset requests THEN the system SHALL implement CSRF protection on all forms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during the password reset process, so that I understand what actions to take next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting the forgot password form THEN the system SHALL show loading state during processing
2. WHEN the reset email is sent THEN the system SHALL display a success screen with next steps
3. WHEN there are form validation errors THEN the system SHALL display clear, specific error messages
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
5. WHEN the reset link expires THEN the system SHALL provide a clear message and option to request a new reset
6. WHEN the password is successfully reset THEN the system SHALL display confirmation and redirect to login
