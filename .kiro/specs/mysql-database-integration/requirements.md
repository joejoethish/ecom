# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MySQL Database Integration project involves migrating the current SQLite-based e-commerce platform to a production-ready MySQL database system. This migration includes data transfer, performance optimization, backup strategies, and enhanced security measures suitable for a scalable e-commerce environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from SQLite to MySQL, so that the platform can handle increased traffic and provide better performance and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up MySQL THEN the system SHALL configure a MySQL server with appropriate performance settings
2. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing data integrity and relationships
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all current functionality without data loss
4. WHEN switching databases THEN the system SHALL update all database connections and configurations
5. WHEN testing the migration THEN the system SHALL verify data consistency between old and new databases
6. WHEN deploying MySQL THEN the system SHALL ensure zero-downtime migration for production environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized database schemas and indexes, so that the application performs efficiently with large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating database schemas THEN the system SHALL implement proper indexing strategies for all frequently queried fields
2. WHEN designing tables THEN the system SHALL use appropriate data types and constraints for optimal storage
3. WHEN handling relationships THEN the system SHALL implement foreign key constraints with proper cascading rules
4. WHEN optimizing queries THEN the system SHALL analyze and improve slow-performing database operations
5. WHEN scaling the database THEN the system SHALL support partitioning and sharding strategies
6. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide query analysis and optimization recommendations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated backup and recovery procedures, so that data is protected and can be restored in case of failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring backups THEN the system SHALL implement automated daily full backups and hourly incremental backups
2. WHEN storing backups THEN the system SHALL encrypt backup files and store them in multiple locations
3. WHEN testing recovery THEN the system SHALL regularly verify backup integrity and restoration procedures
4. WHEN a failure occurs THEN the system SHALL provide point-in-time recovery capabilities
5. WHEN managing backup retention THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up old backups according to retention policies
6. WHEN monitoring backups THEN the system SHALL alert administrators of backup failures or issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want enhanced database security measures, so that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access and breaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring database access THEN the system SHALL implement role-based access control with minimal required privileges
2. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt personally identifiable information at rest
3. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL use SSL/TLS encryption for all database communications
4. WHEN auditing access THEN the system SHALL log all database access attempts and modifications
5. WHEN detecting threats THEN the system SHALL monitor for suspicious database activities and unauthorized access attempts
6. WHEN managing credentials THEN the system SHALL implement secure credential storage and rotation policies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database connection pooling and optimization, so that the application can handle concurrent users efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling with appropriate pool sizes
2. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL optimize connection usage and prevent connection exhaustion
3. WHEN monitoring connections THEN the system SHALL track connection pool metrics and performance
4. WHEN scaling the application THEN the system SHALL support read replicas for improved read performance
5. WHEN handling transactions THEN the system SHALL implement proper transaction isolation and deadlock handling
6. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL cache frequently accessed data and implement query optimization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting, so that I can proactively manage database health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring database health THEN the system SHALL track key performance metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage
2. WHEN detecting issues THEN the system SHALL alert administrators of performance degradation or errors
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide detailed query performance analytics and slow query logs
4. WHEN managing capacity THEN the system SHALL monitor storage usage and predict capacity requirements
5. WHEN ensuring availability THEN the system SHALL implement health checks and automatic failover mechanisms
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide regular database performance and usage reports

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless application integration, so that the MySQL migration doesn't break existing functionality or require extensive code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating the application THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing Django ORM models
2. WHEN migrating code THEN the system SHALL update database-specific configurations and settings
3. WHEN testing integration THEN the system SHALL verify all existing API endpoints and functionality work correctly
4. WHEN handling migrations THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities in case of issues
5. WHEN deploying changes THEN the system SHALL support staged deployment with testing environments
6. WHEN maintaining compatibility THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing database queries and operations function properly
