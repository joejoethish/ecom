# Authentication System Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive fixing of the authentication system for both regular users and admin users in the multi-vendor e-commerce platform. The current authentication system has several issues including incomplete admin authentication flows, missing email verification, inconsistent error handling, and broken password reset functionality. This fix will ensure all authentication flows work correctly without any issues.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account, send email verification, and redirect to dashboard with success message
3. WHEN a user submits invalid registration data THEN the system SHALL display specific validation errors for each field without creating an account

5. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user, create session, and redirect to appropriate dashboard
6. WHEN a user submits invalid login credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message without revealing whether email exists
7. WHEN an authenticated user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL invalidate all tokens, clear session, and redirect to login page
8. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send secure reset email if email exists, always showing success message
9. WHEN a user clicks valid password reset link THEN the system SHALL display password reset form with token validation
