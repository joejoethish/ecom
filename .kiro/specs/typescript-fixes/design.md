# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach to fix TypeScript errors in the frontend codebase. The solution will address issues in Redux store configuration, component props, API services, test files, and utility functions. The goal is to ensure type safety throughout the application while maintaining functionality.

## Architecture

The existing architecture will be maintained, with improvements to type definitions and interfaces. The main areas of focus will be:

1. **Redux Store and Actions**: Ensuring proper typing for the Redux store, actions, and middleware
2. **Component Props and Interfaces**: Fixing type errors in component props and interfaces
3. **API Services and Data Models**: Enhancing type safety in API services and data models
4. **Test Files**: Addressing type errors in test files
5. **Utility Functions and Hooks**: Fixing type errors in utility functions and custom hooks

## Components and Interfaces

### Redux Store and Actions

The Redux store needs proper typing for async actions and middleware. We'll:

1. Update the Redux store configuration to use properly typed middleware
2. Fix the typing of async thunk actions to ensure they're compatible with the dispatch function
3. Ensure all selectors properly type the state and its properties

```typescript
// Example of properly typed middleware configuration
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => 
    getDefaultMiddleware().concat(thunkMiddleware),
});
```

### Component Props and Interfaces

Components need proper typing for their props and data from the Redux store. We'll:

1. Update component prop interfaces to match the expected types
2. Ensure data from the Redux store is properly typed
3. Add type guards or optional chaining for conditional rendering based on data properties

```typescript
// Example of properly typed component props
interface OrderDetailsProps {
  order: Order;
}

// Example of type guard for conditional rendering
const hasReturnRequests = (order: Order): order is Order & { return_requests: ReturnRequest[] } => {
  return 'return_requests' in order && Array.isArray(order.return_requests);
};
```

### API Services and Data Models

API services and data models need proper typing for request and response data. We'll:

1. Update API service functions to properly type response data
2. Ensure consistent typing of data models throughout the application
3. Add proper typing for error handling

```typescript
// Example of properly typed API service function
const fetchDashboardMetrics = async (): Promise<DashboardMetrics> => {
  const response = await apiClient.get<DashboardMetrics>('/admin/dashboard/metrics');
  return response.data;
};
```

### Test Files

Test files need proper typing for mock data and test utilities. We'll:

1. Update mock data to match the expected types
2. Fix the typing of Redux store configuration in tests
3. Update test utilities to use proper types

```typescript
// Example of properly typed mock store in tests
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk';
import rootReducer from '../store/reducers';

const mockStore = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => 
    getDefaultMiddleware().concat(thunkMiddleware),
});
```

### Utility Functions and Hooks

Utility functions and hooks need proper typing for input and output data. We'll:

1. Update utility functions to properly type input and output
2. Fix the typing of custom hooks
3. Ensure proper typing when interacting with browser APIs

```typescript
// Example of properly typed utility function
const formatCurrency = (amount: number, currency: string): string => {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency,
  }).format(amount);
};
```

## Data Models

We'll update the following data models to ensure they have all required properties:

1. **Order**: Add missing properties like `billing_address`, `timeline`, `return_requests`, and `replacements`
2. **Product**: Ensure all required properties are present
3. **User**: Add missing properties like `is_staff`, `is_superuser`, and `seller_profile`

```typescript
// Example of updated Order interface
interface Order {
  id: string;
  order_number: string;
  // ... existing properties
  billing_address?: Address;
  timeline?: TimelineEvent[];
  return_requests?: ReturnRequest[];
  replacements?: Replacement[];
}
```

## Error Handling

We'll improve error handling by:

1. Properly typing error objects
2. Using type guards to check for specific error types
3. Adding fallback values for potentially undefined properties

```typescript
// Example of properly typed error handling
try {
  const data = await fetchData();
  return data;
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof AxiosError) {
    return handleApiError(error);
  }
  return handleGenericError(error as Error);
}
```

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will focus on:

1. Ensuring all fixed code passes TypeScript compilation
2. Verifying that the application functionality remains unchanged
3. Running existing tests to ensure they still pass with the updated types

We'll use the following approach:
1. Run TypeScript compiler to identify errors
2. Fix errors in a systematic way, starting with core types and interfaces
3. Verify fixes by running TypeScript compiler again
4. Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow these steps:

1. Update core type definitions and interfaces
2. Fix Redux store and action types
3. Update component prop types
4. Fix API service and data model types
5. Update test file types
6. Fix utility function and hook types

This approach ensures that we address the most fundamental type issues first, which will help resolve dependent type issues later in the process.
