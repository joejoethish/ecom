# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to fix all TypeScript errors in the frontend codebase to ensure type safety, improve code quality, and prevent runtime errors. The current codebase has multiple TypeScript errors that need to be addressed systematically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all TypeScript errors related to Redux store and async actions, so that the application has proper type safety for state management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redux async actions are dispatched THEN the system SHALL properly type the action creators and their return values
2. WHEN configuring the Redux store with middleware THEN the system SHALL use properly typed middleware
3. WHEN using Redux selectors THEN the system SHALL properly type the state and its properties

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all TypeScript errors related to component props and interfaces, so that components receive and use properly typed data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components receive props THEN the system SHALL validate that the props match the expected types
2. WHEN components use data from the Redux store THEN the system SHALL ensure the data matches the expected types
3. WHEN components render conditional content based on data properties THEN the system SHALL verify those properties exist on the data type

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all TypeScript errors related to API services and data models, so that data fetching and manipulation is type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API services return data THEN the system SHALL properly type the response data
2. WHEN data models are used throughout the application THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent typing
3. WHEN handling API errors THEN the system SHALL properly type the error objects

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all TypeScript errors in test files, so that tests are properly typed and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mocking data for tests THEN the system SHALL ensure the mock data matches the expected types
2. WHEN testing components with Redux THEN the system SHALL properly configure the test store with typed middleware
3. WHEN testing hooks and utilities THEN the system SHALL use properly typed test utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all TypeScript errors related to utility functions and hooks, so that they provide type safety throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions process data THEN the system SHALL properly type the input and output
2. WHEN custom hooks manage state THEN the system SHALL properly type the state and its updaters
3. WHEN hooks interact with browser APIs THEN the system SHALL properly type the API interfaces
