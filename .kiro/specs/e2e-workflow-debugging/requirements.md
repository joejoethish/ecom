# E2E Workflow Debugging System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive end-to-end workflow debugging and validation system for the e-commerce platform. The system will provide tools, utilities, and automated checks to ensure seamless integration between the Next.js frontend, Django REST API backend, and MySQL database. It addresses the critical need to trace, debug, and validate complete user workflows from frontend interactions through API calls to database operations and back to the user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Route Mapping and API Discovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically discover and map all frontend routes and their corresponding API calls, so that I can understand the complete request flow architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scans the Next.js application THEN it SHALL identify all pages, API routes, and dynamic routes
2. WHEN analyzing frontend components THEN the system SHALL extract all API calls including fetch, axios, and server-side requests
3. WHEN mapping routes THEN the system SHALL document the HTTP methods, endpoints, and expected payloads for each API call
4. WHEN generating the route map THEN the system SHALL create a visual representation showing frontend → API → backend connections
5. IF a frontend route makes multiple API calls THEN the system SHALL document the sequence and dependencies

### Requirement 2: Backend API Endpoint Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically validate all Django REST API endpoints with their request/response formats and authentication requirements, so that I can ensure API consistency and completeness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scans Django URLs THEN it SHALL identify all API endpoints with their HTTP methods
2. WHEN analyzing API views THEN the system SHALL extract serializer classes, authentication requirements, and permission classes
3. WHEN validating endpoints THEN the system SHALL test each endpoint for proper response format and status codes
4. WHEN checking authentication THEN the system SHALL verify JWT token handling and session management
5. IF an endpoint requires specific permissions THEN the system SHALL document the required user roles and authentication methods

### Requirement 3: Database Connection and Query Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate database connections, migrations, and query performance, so that I can ensure data layer reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system checks database connectivity THEN it SHALL verify MySQL connection parameters and connection pooling
2. WHEN validating migrations THEN the system SHALL ensure all Django migrations are applied and consistent
3. WHEN analyzing queries THEN the system SHALL identify slow queries, N+1 problems, and missing indexes
4. WHEN checking data integrity THEN the system SHALL verify foreign key relationships and constraint violations
5. IF performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations

### Requirement 4: End-to-End Workflow Tracing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to trace complete user workflows from frontend interaction to database response, so that I can identify bottlenecks and failure points in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracing a user login workflow THEN the system SHALL monitor frontend form submission → API authentication → database user lookup → JWT generation → frontend token storage
2. WHEN tracing product catalog access THEN the system SHALL monitor frontend page load → API product fetch → database query → serialization → frontend rendering
3. WHEN tracing cart operations THEN the system SHALL monitor add/remove actions → API cart updates → database modifications → frontend state updates
4. WHEN tracing checkout workflow THEN the system SHALL monitor payment processing → order creation → inventory updates → confirmation display
5. IF any step in the workflow fails THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information and suggest remediation steps

### Requirement 5: Automated Testing and Validation Tools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tools to test API endpoints, validate responses, and check system health, so that I can quickly identify and resolve integration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running API tests THEN the system SHALL automatically test all endpoints with valid and invalid payloads
2. WHEN validating responses THEN the system SHALL check response format, status codes, and data consistency
3. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL verify token generation, refresh, and expiration handling
4. WHEN checking CORS configuration THEN the system SHALL validate cross-origin requests from the frontend
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure reports with suggested fixes

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging across all system layers with correlation IDs, so that I can trace requests across the entire stack and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request enters the system THEN it SHALL be assigned a unique correlation ID that follows the request through all layers
2. WHEN logging frontend events THEN the system SHALL capture user interactions, API calls, and error states
3. WHEN logging backend events THEN the system SHALL capture request processing, database queries, and response generation
4. WHEN logging database events THEN the system SHALL capture query execution times, connection pool status, and error conditions
5. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL aggregate related log entries using correlation IDs for complete error context

### Requirement 7: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor system performance across all layers and receive optimization recommendations, so that I can maintain optimal user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring frontend performance THEN the system SHALL track page load times, API response times, and rendering performance
2. WHEN monitoring backend performance THEN the system SHALL track API endpoint response times, database query performance, and memory usage
3. WHEN monitoring database performance THEN the system SHALL track query execution times, connection pool utilization, and slow query identification
4. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with specific optimization recommendations
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide historical comparison data and trend analysis

### Requirement 8: Interactive Debugging Dashboard

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an interactive dashboard to visualize system health, trace workflows, and access debugging tools, so that I can efficiently diagnose and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN it SHALL display real-time system health metrics for frontend, backend, and database
2. WHEN viewing workflow traces THEN the dashboard SHALL provide interactive visualization of request flows with timing information
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the dashboard SHALL provide tools to replay requests, modify payloads, and test different scenarios
4. WHEN analyzing errors THEN the dashboard SHALL group related errors and provide suggested resolution steps
5. IF system issues are detected THEN the dashboard SHALL highlight problem areas and provide direct links to relevant logs and metrics
