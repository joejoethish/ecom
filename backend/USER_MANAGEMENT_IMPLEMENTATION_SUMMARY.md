# User Management CRUD Operations Implementation Summary

## Task 4: Implement user management CRUD operations ✅ COMPLETED

This document summarizes the implementation of user management CRUD operations as specified in task 4 of the authentication system fix.

## Subtasks Completed

### 4.1 Create user management API endpoints ✅

**Implemented Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/auth/users/` - List users with pagination and filtering
- `POST /api/v1/auth/users/` - Create new user (admin only)
- `GET /api/v1/auth/users/{id}/` - Get user profile by ID
- `PUT /api/v1/auth/users/{id}/` - Update user profile by ID
- `DELETE /api/v1/auth/users/{id}/` - Delete user account by ID

**Features:**
- Pagination support with configurable page size (max 100 items)
- Filtering by user_type, is_active, is_verified
- Search functionality across email, username, first_name, last_name
- Admin-only access control
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit logging for admin actions

### 4.2 Create user self-management endpoints ✅

**Implemented Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/auth/users/me/` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/v1/auth/users/me/` - Update current user profile
- `DELETE /api/v1/auth/users/me/` - Delete current user account (self-deletion)

**Features:**
- Self-service profile management
- Password confirmation required for account deletion
- Profile data validation
- Automatic session cleanup on account deletion

### 4.3 Create session management endpoints ✅

**Implemented Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/auth/users/me/sessions/` - List current user's active sessions
- `DELETE /api/v1/auth/users/me/sessions/all/` - Terminate all user sessions
- `DELETE /api/v1/auth/users/me/sessions/{session_id}/` - Terminate specific session

**Features:**
- Session listing with device information
- Bulk session termination
- Individual session management
- Session security tracking

## Implementation Details

### New Serializers Added

1. **UserListSerializer** - Optimized for user listing with minimal fields
2. **AdminUserCreateSerializer** - For admin user creation with validation
3. **AdminUserUpdateSerializer** - For admin user updates
4. **UserSelfDeleteSerializer** - For secure account self-deletion
5. **Enhanced UserSessionSerializer** - With device information

### New Views Added

1. **UserManagementView** - Handles user listing and creation
2. **UserDetailView** - Handles individual user operations
3. **UserSelfManagementView** - Handles current user operations
4. **UserSessionManagementView** - Handles session listing and bulk operations
5. **UserSessionDetailView** - Handles individual session operations

### Security Features

- **Permission-based access control**: Admin permissions required for user management
- **Self-service restrictions**: Users can only manage their own data
- **Password confirmation**: Required for sensitive operations like account deletion
- **Session security**: Automatic session cleanup on account changes
- **Audit logging**: All admin actions are logged
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation for all endpoints

### URL Patterns

All endpoints are properly routed under `/api/v1/auth/`:

```
/api/v1/auth/users/                          # User management (list/create)
/api/v1/auth/users/{id}/                     # User detail operations
/api/v1/auth/users/me/                       # Current user operations
/api/v1/auth/users/me/sessions/              # Session management
/api/v1/auth/users/me/sessions/{session_id}/ # Individual session operations
```

### Error Handling

- Consistent error response format with error codes
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed validation error messages
- Security-conscious error messages (no information leakage)

### Testing

- Comprehensive test suite created (`test_user_management.py`)
- Tests cover all endpoints and scenarios
- Permission testing included
- Error case testing included

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Requirement 6.1**: User management CRUD operations with proper validation
✅ **Requirement 6.2**: User profile management and account deletion
✅ **Requirement 5.1**: Session listing functionality
✅ **Requirement 5.2**: Session termination capabilities

## API Response Format

All endpoints follow a consistent response format:

```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "message": "Operation result message",
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Error description",
    "details": {} // Validation errors if applicable
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

The user management CRUD operations are fully implemented and ready for use. The implementation includes:

- Complete API endpoints for all required operations
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security best practices
- Audit logging
- Test coverage

All subtasks (4.1, 4.2, 4.3) have been completed successfully, and the main task 4 is marked as complete.
