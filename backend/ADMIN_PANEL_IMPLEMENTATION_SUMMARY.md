  - Typed settings (string, integer, boolean, JSON, etc.)
  - Category organization (general, security, email, etc.)
  - Encryption support for sensitive settings
  - Version tracking and change history

#### Audit and Security Tables
- **activity_logs**: Comprehensive audit trails
  - JSON change tracking (before/after values)
  - Request details (IP, user agent, method, path)
  - Severity levels and success tracking
  - Generic foreign key for any model

- **admin_sessions**: Session management and tracking
  - Device and browser detection

  - Multiple report types (sales, inventory, financial, etc.)
  - Scheduling options (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
  - Multiple output formats (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON)
  - Recipient management and execution tracking

### 2. Database Features Implemented

#### Indexes
- Comprehensive indexing strategy for optimal query performance
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Indexes on foreign keys and frequently searched fields
- Date-based indexes for time-series queries

#### Database Views
- Basic dashboard statistics view (ready for when dependent tables exist)
- Admin activity summary view
- Security alerts view

#### Model Features
- UUID primary keys for admin users
- JSON fields for flexible data storage
- Generic foreign keys for audit trails
- Hierarchical relationships (roles, permissions)
- Automatic timestamp tracking
- Soft delete capabilities where appropriate

### 3. Security Features

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Separate admin user model (isolated from customer users)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with inheritance
- Granular permissions (500+ possible permissions)
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Two-factor authentication support
- Session management with concurrent login limits

#### Audit & Monitoring
- Comprehensive activity logging with JSON change tracking
- Login attempt tracking with risk scoring
- Suspicious activity detection
- IP-based access monitoring
- Session security scoring

#### Data Protection
- Encrypted storage for sensitive settings
- Permission-based data access
- Audit trails for all critical operations
- GDPR compliance features

### 4. Initial Data Setup

#### Permissions Created (33 total)
- Dashboard permissions (view, stats)
- Product management (view, create, edit, delete, export, import)
- Order management (view, edit, delete, export)
- Customer management (view, edit, delete, export)
- Inventory management (view, edit, manage)
- Analytics and reporting (view, export, create)
- Settings management (view, edit, configure)
- User management (view, create, edit, delete)
- System administration (manage, configure)

#### Roles Created (4 total)
- **Super Admin**: Full system access with all permissions
- **Admin**: Administrative access (excludes system administration)
- **Manager**: Business operations access (no delete permissions)
- **Analyst**: Read-only access for analysis and reporting

#### System Settings Created (19 total)
- General settings (site name, description, email, timezone)
- Security settings (session timeout, login attempts, 2FA, password policy)
- Performance settings (cache timeout, page size, export limits)
- Email configuration (SMTP settings, notifications)
- Backup settings (enabled, retention, schedule)

#### Default Super Admin User
- Username: `superadmin`
- Password: `admin123` (must be changed immediately)
- Role: Super Admin with all permissions
- Status: Active, must change password on first login

### 5. Django Integration

#### Models
- All models extend Django's base models appropriately
- Custom managers and querysets where needed
- Model methods for common operations
- Property methods for computed fields

#### Admin Interface
- Comprehensive Django admin configuration
- Custom list displays and filters
- Read-only fields for audit data
- Proper field organization and permissions

#### Management Commands
- `setup_admin_panel`: Initialize permissions, roles, settings, and super user
- Supports `--create-superuser` flag for initial setup

#### Signals
- Automatic activity logging for model changes
- Login/logout tracking
- Failed login attempt handling
- Account lockout automation

### 6. Performance Optimizations

#### Database Level
- Strategic indexing for common queries
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Partitioning preparation for large tables
- Query optimization for dashboard views

#### Application Level
- Efficient querysets with select_related/prefetch_related
- Caching strategies for settings and permissions
- Bulk operations for data management
- Pagination for large datasets

## Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup
1. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate admin_panel`
2. Setup initial data: `python manage.py setup_admin_panel --create-superuser`
3. Change default password immediately after first login

### Adding New Permissions
```python
AdminPermission.objects.create(
    codename='module.action.resource',
    name='Human Readable Name',
    module='module_name',
    action='action_type',
    resource='resource_name',
    is_sensitive=False,
    requires_mfa=False
)
```

### Creating Admin Users
```python
admin_user = AdminUser.objects.create_user(
    username='admin_username',
    email='admin@example.com',
    password='secure_password',
    role='admin',
    department='it'
)
```

### Checking Permissions
```python
if admin_user.permissions.filter(codename='products.view.all').exists():
    # User has permission to view products
    pass
```

## Security Considerations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Change default super admin password
2. Configure proper email settings for notifications
3. Set up proper backup procedures
4. Configure 2FA for sensitive accounts
5. Review and adjust permission assignments

### Ongoing Security
- Regular audit log reviews
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Update security settings as needed
- Regular permission audits
- Session monitoring and cleanup

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- MySQL triggers for automatic audit logging (commented in migration)
- Table partitioning for large audit tables
- Advanced analytics views
- Integration with external identity providers
- Enhanced security monitoring

### Scalability Considerations
- Connection pooling configuration
- Read replica support
- Caching layer implementation
- Background task processing
- Performance monitoring
