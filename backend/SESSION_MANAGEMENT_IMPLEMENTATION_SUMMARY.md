# Session Management Endpoints Implementation Summary

## Task 4.3: Create Session Management Endpoints

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### Requirements Implemented

This implementation satisfies **Requirements 5.1 and 5.2** from the authentication system fix specification:

- **Requirement 5.1**: Session listing functionality with device and location information
- **Requirement 5.2**: Session termination (single and all sessions)

### Endpoints Implemented

#### 1. GET /api/v1/auth/users/me/sessions/
- **Purpose**: List user sessions with device and activity information
- **Authentication**: Required (JWT Bearer token)
- **Response**: JSON with session list including device info, IP addresses, and activity timestamps
- **Features**:
  - Shows all active sessions for the authenticated user
  - Includes device information (browser, OS, device type)
  - Shows IP addresses and locations
  - Indicates which session is the current one
  - Provides last activity timestamps

#### 2. DELETE /api/v1/auth/users/me/sessions/{session_id}/
- **Purpose**: Terminate a specific user session
- **Authentication**: Required (JWT Bearer token)
- **Parameters**: `session_id` - ID of the session to terminate
- **Response**: Success/error message with session details
- **Security**: Users can only terminate their own sessions
- **Features**:
  - Validates session ownership
  - Provides detailed error messages for invalid sessions
  - Returns device information of terminated session

#### 3. DELETE /api/v1/auth/users/me/sessions/all/
- **Purpose**: Terminate all user sessions (logout from all devices)
- **Authentication**: Required (JWT Bearer token)
- **Response**: Success message with count of terminated sessions
- **Features**:
  - Optionally excludes current session from termination
  - Returns count of terminated sessions
  - Useful for security purposes (e.g., password change, suspicious activity)

### Implementation Components

#### Models
- **UserSession**: Enhanced model with device tracking, IP addresses, and session management
  - Fields: `user`, `session_key`, `ip_address`, `user_agent`, `device_info`, `location`, `is_active`, `last_activity`, `login_method`
  - Methods: `terminate()`, `device_name` property
  - Indexes for performance optimization

#### Services
- **SessionManagementService**: Business logic for session operations
  - `create_session()`: Create new session with device tracking
  - `get_user_sessions()`: Retrieve user sessions with filtering
  - `terminate_session()`: Terminate specific session
  - `terminate_all_sessions()`: Terminate all user sessions
  - `cleanup_expired_sessions()`: Maintenance functionality

#### Views
- **UserSessionManagementView**: Handles GET requests for session listing
- **UserSessionDetailView**: Handles DELETE requests for specific sessions
- **UserSessionTerminateAllView**: Handles DELETE requests for all sessions
- All views include proper error handling and security validation

#### Serializers
- **UserSessionSerializer**: Serializes session data for API responses
  - Includes all necessary fields for frontend display
  - Provides device_name as computed field
  - Read-only fields for security

#### URL Configuration
- Properly configured in `apps/authentication/urls.py`
- Included in API v1 routing at `/api/v1/auth/`
- Named URL patterns for reverse lookups

### Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT authentication
2. **User Isolation**: Users can only access/manage their own sessions
3. **Session Validation**: Proper validation of session ownership and existence
4. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak information
5. **Rate Limiting**: Inherits from authentication system rate limiting

### Testing

- Comprehensive test suite in `apps/authentication/tests/test_session_endpoints.py`
- Tests cover all endpoints, error cases, and security scenarios
- Includes tests for unauthorized access and cross-user session access

### API Response Format

All endpoints follow consistent response format:
```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "...",
  "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." }
}
```

### Integration

- Fully integrated with existing authentication system
- Works with JWT token authentication
- Compatible with existing user management features
- Supports multi-device session tracking

## Verification

✅ All URL patterns are properly configured
✅ All models have required fields and methods
✅ All service methods are implemented
✅ All serializers include necessary fields
✅ All view classes exist and handle requests properly
✅ Comprehensive test coverage exists
✅ Security requirements are met
✅ Requirements 5.1 and 5.2 are fully satisfied

## Usage Examples

### List Sessions
```bash
GET /api/v1/auth/users/me/sessions/
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### Terminate Specific Session
```bash
DELETE /api/v1/auth/users/me/sessions/123/
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### Terminate All Sessions
```bash
DELETE /api/v1/auth/users/me/sessions/all/
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

This implementation provides a complete, secure, and well-tested session management system that meets all specified requirements.
