# Database Monitoring and Alerting System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 7: "Build database monitoring and alerting system" from the MySQL Database Integration specification. The implementation provides comprehensive database monitoring capabilities including performance tracking, slow query analysis, replication monitoring, and intelligent alerting.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Core Monitoring System (`core/database_monitor.py`)

**DatabaseMonitor Class**
- Real-time metrics collection from MySQL databases
- Comprehensive performance tracking (connections, queries, replication, system resources)
- Health score calculation and status determination
- Automatic recovery mechanisms for critical issues
- Thread-safe operation with configurable monitoring intervals

**Key Features:**
- **Metrics Collection**: CPU, memory, disk usage, connection statistics, query performance
- **MySQL-Specific Metrics**: InnoDB buffer pool, thread cache, query cache, replication status
- **Health Scoring**: Intelligent algorithm that considers multiple factors
- **Automatic Recovery**: Connection pool reset, slow query termination, memory cleanup

**SlowQueryAnalyzer Class**
- Pattern-based query analysis
- Optimization recommendations based on query structure
- Severity classification (low, medium, high, critical)

### 2. Alerting System (`core/database_alerting.py`)

**DatabaseAlerting Class**
- Multi-channel alert delivery (email, webhook, Slack)
- Alert suppression and acknowledgment
- Escalation and resolution tracking
- Customizable alert templates and thresholds

**Alert Channels:**
- **Email**: HTML/text alerts with detailed recommendations

- `POST /core/api/monitoring/config/threshold/` - Update thresholds
- `POST /core/api/monitoring/control/` - Control monitoring system
- `POST /core/api/monitoring/alerts/test-channels/` - Test alert channels

### 4. Management Command (`core/management/commands/database_monitor.py`)

**Command Actions:**
- `start` - Start monitoring with optional watch mode
- `stop` - Stop monitoring system
- `status` - Display current system status
- `metrics` - Show detailed metrics
- `alerts` - Display active alerts and history
- `test-alerts` - Test all alert channels
- `config` - Show monitoring configuration

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
python manage.py database_monitor start --interval 30
python manage.py database_monitor status --watch
python manage.py database_monitor metrics --database default --hours 24
python manage.py database_monitor alerts --json
```

DB_ALERT_CONNECTION_CRITICAL = 95.0
DB_ALERT_QUERY_TIME_WARNING = 2.0
DB_ALERT_QUERY_TIME_CRITICAL = 5.0
DB_ALERT_SLOW_QUERIES_WARNING = 10.0
DB_ALERT_SLOW_QUERIES_CRITICAL = 50.0

DB_ALERT_REPLICATION_CRITICAL = 30.0
```

### Alert Channels Configuration

DB_ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS = ['admin@example.com']
DB_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL = 'https://hooks.example.com/alerts'
DB_ALERT_SLACK_WEBHOOK = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/...'
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Start Monitoring
```python
from core.database_monitor import get_database_monitor
from core.database_alerting import get_database_alerting

monitor = get_database_monitor()
alerting = get_database_alerting()
monitor.add_alert_callback(alerting.send_alert)
```

### 2. Access Current Metrics
```python
metrics = monitor.get_current_metrics()
health = monitor.get_health_summary()
```

### 3. Configure Alerts
```python
monitor.update_threshold('connection_usage', warning=85.0, critical=95.0)
alerting.suppress_alert('default', 'slow_queries', duration_minutes=60)
```

### 4. API Integration
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     http://localhost:8000/core/api/monitoring/health/
```

## Security Considerations

- API endpoints require authentication
- Admin-only endpoints for configuration changes
- Alert acknowledgment tracking with user attribution
- Secure credential handling for alert channels
- Rate limiting on alert notifications

## Performance Impact

- Minimal overhead with configurable monitoring intervals
- Efficient metrics collection using connection pooling
- Cached metrics for API responses
- Background thread processing to avoid blocking
- Automatic cleanup of historical data

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with external monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Predictive capacity planning
- Advanced query optimization recommendations
- Custom dashboard widgets
