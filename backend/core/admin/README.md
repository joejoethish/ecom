```

### 2. Configure Settings

Add the following to your Django settings:

```python
# Database Administration Settings
BACKUP_DIR = '/path/to/backups'
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY = 'your-encryption-key-here'
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS = 30

# Monitoring Settings
CONNECTION_MONITORING_ENABLED = True
CONNECTION_MONITORING_INTERVAL = 30

# Security Settings
DB_SECURITY_ENABLED = True
DB_AUDIT_ENABLED = True
DB_THREAT_DETECTION_ENABLED = True
```

### 3. URL Configuration

The database administration interface is available at `/db-admin/` and includes:

- Dashboard: `/db-admin/dashboard/`
- Health Check: `/db-admin/health-check/`
- Backup Management: `/db-admin/backup-management/`
- User Management: `/db-admin/user-management/`
- Performance Report: `/db-admin/performance-report/`

## Usage Guide

### Accessing the Interface

1. Start your Django development server
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/db-admin/`
3. Log in with your admin credentials

### Creating Backups

1. Go to Backup Management
2. Select backup type (Full or Incremental)
3. Choose target database
4. Click "Create Backup"
5. Monitor progress and verify completion

### Managing Database Users

1. Go to User Management
2. View existing users and their privileges
3. Create new users with specific permissions
4. Use templates for common user types:
   - Read-only users
   - Application users
   - Backup users
   - Monitoring users

### Running Health Checks

1. Go to Health Check
2. Click "Run Health Check" for basic assessment
3. Use "Full Diagnostic" for comprehensive analysis
4. Review recommendations and take action

### Performance Monitoring

1. Go to Performance Report
2. Select time range for analysis
3. Review key metrics:
   - Queries per second
   - Connection usage
   - Buffer pool hit rate
   - Slow query analysis
4. Export reports for further analysis

## API Endpoints

The administration interface provides REST API endpoints for automation:

### Backup Management
- `POST /db-admin/api/create-backup/` - Create new backup
- `POST /db-admin/api/verify-backup/` - Verify backup integrity
- `POST /db-admin/api/restore-backup/` - Restore from backup

### Monitoring
- `POST /db-admin/api/refresh-metrics/` - Refresh database metrics
- `POST /db-admin/api/test-connection/` - Test database connection

### User Management
- `POST /db-admin/api/create-user/` - Create database user

### Reporting
- `GET /db-admin/api/export-report/` - Export performance reports

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Only staff users can access the administration interface
- Superuser privileges required for sensitive operations
- All actions are logged for audit purposes

### Data Protection
- Backups are encrypted using AES-256
- Sensitive data fields use field-level encryption
- SSL/TLS encryption for database connections
- Password policies enforced for database users

### Audit Logging
- All database operations are logged
- Security events are tracked and alerted
- Failed login attempts are monitored
- Suspicious activity detection

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Automatic Monitoring
- Database metrics collected every 30 seconds
- Health checks run continuously
- Performance thresholds monitored
- Replication lag tracking

### Alert Conditions
- Connection pool usage > 80%
- Slow query rate > 5%
- Replication lag > 30 seconds
- Disk usage > 85%
- Failed login attempts > 5 per hour

### Alert Delivery
- Email notifications to administrators
- Dashboard alerts and warnings
- Security event logging
- Integration with external monitoring systems

## Backup Strategy

### Backup Types
- **Full Backups**: Complete database dump (daily at 2 AM)
- **Incremental Backups**: Changes since last backup (every 4 hours)
- **Point-in-time Recovery**: Using binary logs

### Backup Features
- Compression to reduce storage space
- Encryption for data security
- Integrity verification
- Automated cleanup based on retention policy
- Multiple storage location support

### Recovery Procedures
1. Select backup from management interface
2. Verify backup integrity
3. Choose target database
4. Initiate restore process
5. Monitor restoration progress
6. Validate restored data

   - Check failed login attempts
   - Verify user permissions
   - Monitor suspicious activities

### Log Files
- Django logs: `logs/django.log`
- Database monitoring: Application logs
- Security events: Database security events table
- Backup operations: Backup manager logs

## Testing

Run the test suite to validate functionality:

```bash
python test_database_admin_tools.py
```

This will test:
