## 🛠 Usage Examples

### Basic Demo Execution
```bash
python manage.py run_performance_demo
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Save results to file
python manage.py run_performance_demo --output-file results.json

# Verbose output
python manage.py run_performance_demo --verbose

# Programmatic usage
from apps.debugging.performance_demo import PerformanceDemo
demo = PerformanceDemo()
results = demo.run_full_demo()
```
