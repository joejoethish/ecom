## üîß Configuration

### Django Settings
```python
# Backup System Settings
BACKUP_SCHEDULER_ENABLED = True
BACKUP_DIR = '/path/to/backups'
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY = 'secure-encryption-key'
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS = 30
BACKUP_COMPRESSION_ENABLED = True
BACKUP_VERIFY_ENABLED = True

# Schedule Configuration
BACKUP_FULL_HOUR = 2  # 2 AM daily
BACKUP_INCREMENTAL_INTERVAL = 4  # Every 4 hours
BACKUP_CLEANUP_HOUR = 3  # 3 AM daily

# Alert Configuration
BACKUP_ALERT_RECIPIENTS = ['admin@example.com']
BACKUP_ALERT_ON_FAILURE = True
BACKUP_MAX_FAILURES = 3
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_NAME=ecommerce_db
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3307

# Backup Configuration
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-key-here
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```

## üß™ Testing Results

### Simple Backup Test Results
All core functionality verified with `simple_backup_test.py`:

- ‚úÖ **MySQL Connection**: Successfully connected to MySQL 8.0.42
- ‚úÖ **mysqldump Connection**: Command-line backup tool working
- ‚úÖ **Backup Encryption**: AES encryption/decryption functional
- ‚úÖ **Backup Creation**: Full backup with 87.3% compression ratio
- ‚úÖ **Backup Restore**: Complete restore cycle successful

### Performance Metrics
- **Backup Size**: ~196KB original ‚Üí ~25KB compressed (87.3% compression)
- **Backup Time**: ~2 seconds for test database
- **Restore Time**: ~10 seconds for full restore
- **Encryption Overhead**: Minimal performance impact
